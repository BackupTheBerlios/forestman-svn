For the current clients there are two tables that are imported using ArcView with AVPython to export to mysql.
Some old copies of this data are placed here to allow people to run the system without these tools.

Files:

gistabledefs.txt - sql create statments to make the tables
rodal.tab - data for table rodal, the table of forest stand data
siglim.tab - data for table siglim, the table of property data

the .tab files are data suitable for import into mysql with LOAD DATA INFILE
